The telos of this journal is to resurrect Pearse’s ideals in the field of education. To bring back our faith, our culture, our history, our folklore, and our language, out of the mist and into the light to be comprehended once again. For the Gael to rise, phoenix-like from the ashes, reasserting himself in the world as a force for Good, a force for Christ. This ideal explains the choosing of our name, ‘An Dord Fiann’: the name of the horn of na Fianna, who, according to legend, lay asleep, waiting for Ireland to call them to her heart in her time of need. They lie in rest waiting for the horn to be thrice sounded, for its sounds to ring out across the fields and bogs, lakes and rivers, and over the hills and mountains of our beautiful Éire: at which point they will arise and race to her in her time of need. The powerful quote which motivated and inspired the creation of this journal comes from Pearse: “I am nothing so new-fangled as a socialist or a syndicalist, I am old fashioned enough to be a Catholic and a Nationalist”. This quote will serve as a motto for the journal, that despite a wide ranging field of interest and potential articles, we hope that they may endeavour to be, at root, both uniquely Catholic and Nationalist, in a way that only the Irish race could produce.

T﻿his section comes from our introductory article 'The Modern Murder Machine' by Paul Gregory [here](https://andordfiann.ie/blog/the-modern-murder-machine/).
