##### I THE BROAD ARROW

The compliment is paid to England, that never did they commit a useless crime. Every crime committed by the English against the Irish –many as they are– was not done simply for the fun of it, each crime had a more sinister and calculated motive at heart. As Pearse explains, “Humorous as the crimes are, it is not the humour of them, but their utility, that appeals to the English”.

It would be beyond the scope of this essay, and somewhat superfluous to discuss at length the numerous crimes that the English committed. Only a passing knowledge is required to understand the seriousness with which Pearse considers the “most grotesque and horrible of the English inventions for the debasement of Ireland. I mean their education system.” Furthermore he says that the English education system in Ireland “more wickedly does violence to the elementary human rights of Irish children, than would an edict for the general castration of Irish males”.

With this, Pearse is not being extravagant, facetious, or quixotic. Truly for Pearse, this is the worst of their crimes, as it sought to destroy the very root of Irishness. The rest of the crimes were physical manifestations of hatred, and of a desire to eradicate the Irish race, but the English education system in Ireland, or the Murder Machine, as Pearse denoted it, was a spiritual and psychological weapon, designed with the sole intention of weakening, distorting, and ultimately annihilating the soul and eventually the body of the Irish people.

The Murder Machine desired the replacement of the Irish people with mere ‘Things’, with no allegiances or soul, something to be bought and sold. The description of such a destructive force as an “education system” arises from utility and convenience as opposed to any meaningful examination of its purpose. Contrary to the true object of ‘Education’; the fostering, inspiring, and hardening of a people, the English Murder Machine sought to repress, tame, and enervate the Irish people, for “The English are too wise a people to attempt to educate the Irish, in any worthy sense.”

The Murder Machine was consciously designed analogously to a slave education system, diametrically opposed to the education of the free. The free peoples would be taught “all noble and goodly things which would tend to make them strong and proud and valiant” while the slaves to be “sleek, to be obsequious, to be dexterous”. Yet, the slaves outnumber the master, and so, to maintain order, some of the slaves have to internalise the commands of their oppressor and turn against their own kind. This was so successfully done by the English, that many Irish became not only slaves, but eunuchs “who serve for pay a master that they neither love nor hate.”

##### II THE MURDER MACHINE

Pearse describes the English education system in Ireland as a machine, soulless and efficient in carrying out its desired effect —the processing and moulding of Irish children into whatever soulless slaves the English would like them to be.

> Our common parlance has become impressed with the conception of education as some sort of manufacturing process. Our children are the ‘raw material’; we desiderate for their education ‘modern methods’ which must be ‘efficient’ but ‘cheap’; we send them to Clongowes to be ‘finished’; when ‘finished’ they are ‘turned out’; specialists ‘grind’ them for the English Civil Service and the so-called liberal professions.

This is Pearse’s main condemnation against the Murder Machine: it is a machine with ruthless efficiency that manufactures Irish students into model workers for the English Civil Service. A ruthlessness which finds no equal in the natural order, as at least “the ruthlessness of a wild beast has in it a certain mercy —it slays”. Horribly, the Murder Machine doesn’t slay those who pass through its gears and stations, instead, those who pass through remain ‘alive’ (in only the biological sense), but are damned to ‘live’ on without their native soul, a fate often worse than death. Without pity, without passion, the machine grinds on day and night, murdering souls, and leaving its product an unaccounted waste.

The English Civil Service held a firm grip over the affairs of Irish society in the early 20th century, acting as the managerial elite maintaining the ideological and political orthodoxy of the West-Brit and mercilessly quelling all attempts to undermine this hegemony. Pearse noted how the English Murder Machine was designed to produce deracinated and docile administrators of English power, affording the Irish the illusion of control over their own affairs. Little has changed in a century. Now, rather than the English Civil Service, it is an informal collection of foreign and multinational entities that have taken its place in the vacuum created after the formation of the Irish Free State. Consequently, our education system has been adapted to provide for this new managerial stratum, taking the form of the Modern Murder Machine. Irish students are currently ‘taught’ or, more accurately, moulded, finished, turned out, and ground into jobs for foreign and multinational companies such as Google and Facebook. These companies act as the Department of Propaganda for the new Global Civil Service, as they manipulate search engine results and algorithms on social media to control the flow of information, guaranteeing that the masses are only fed that which contributes to the perpetuation of globalist hegemony. 

This Modern Murder Machine, however, appears more deadly than its predecessor. Unsatisfied with only murdering the soul of Irish children who pass through the education system, the modern iteration also seeks the explicit and literal murder of Irish children. With the importation of American liberal social values which were then propagated through the education system, the Irish moral compass was disoriented to such an extent that our population voted in favour of introducing the Molech murder ritual of abortion. These are the fruits of the Modern Murder Machine. It is not only similar, but in many respects, more disastrous than the English antecedent.

In contrast, a true Irish education, Pearse writes should not have

> to do with the manufacture of things, but with fostering the growth of things. And the conditions we should strive to bring about in our education system are not the conditions favourable to the rapid and cheap manufacture of ready-mades, but the conditions favourable to the growth of living organisms.

Emphasised particularly in Pearse’s view of a true Education system is the notion of freedom. A concept particularly hard to grasp as the English word attempts to communicate many distinct meanings, as to make its use virtually ineffective without additional explanation of what was truly meant. The idea of freedom expressed here by Pearse is distinct from that modern understanding which approximates to “do what thou wilt”, that is, the freedom to do and not the freedom from various restrictions. The type of freedom desired by Pearse is a positive vision of freedom from the stifling ‘standardisation’ of modernity, that believes that all facets of the human condition can be comprehended through materialist scientific methods of statistics and analysis.

Instead, Pearse desires the “freedom to the individual school, freedom to the individual teacher, freedom as far as may be to the individual pupil” so that education can instead foster the “right growth of personality”. This right personality could be discovered and fostered in each child through gallant inspiration, through a correct teaching of “religion, patriotism, literature, art, and science” so that it may “affect the character and conduct” of Irish boys and girls.

The only way this fosterage style of education can be achieved is not through “reform, not even revolution, but a vastly bigger thing, a creation”. As the Murder Machine is so lifeless, and soulless, it is impossible to breathe a soul of life into it. No part of this machine can be integrated into a new, ideal system, as one malady in any part of an otherwise healthy body can bring deathly consequences on the rest of the body. 

##### III “I  DENY”

“You cannot reform that which is not; you cannot by any process of reconstruction give organic life to a negation.” A new effort was necessary in Ireland: the creation of an altogether divergent education system, in contradistinction to the English Murder Machine. A system focused on the improvement of the Irish race in body, mind, and soul.

The English Murder Machine was founded on a denial of the Irish religion, nation, and character: “I deny the spirituality of my nation; I deny the lineage of my blood; I deny my rights and responsibilities.” This negation was their Credo, this evil their good.

“To teach a child to deny is the greatest crime a man or State can commit”. To invent such a system of teaching, and then persuade the Irish that this Murder Machine must be defended by Irishmen against attack was to Pearse “the most wonderful thing the English have accomplished in Ireland; and the most wicked.”

##### IV AGAINST MODERNISM

With the advent of Home Rule on the horizon, many speculated as to what form a new Irish education system could take. As is usually the case, short sightedness and vacuous yet perniciously deluding symbolic victories were bandied around like a revolver during a game of Russian roulette. Worse still was the possibility of a subversive character rearing its ugly head, threatening to undermine the chances of a truly insightful, effective, and enduring revival of an Irish education system for the Irish race.

Anticipating potential implementations, some focused on the material benefits such as higher salaries for teachers, others, the comedic potential for Orange boys and girls being compelled to learn Irish. Lastly, for some it represented the dawning of a new age, an age of a progressive and modern Ireland, an Ireland which would surely be in need of a suitably “sound modern education”.

The first view, the materialist one, is not immediately troubling in and of itself, as it is true that there is a certain correlation between the salary of teachers and the quality of an education system, yet this should not be the immediate or focused fruition of Irish control over her education system. Secondly, the prospect of protestant children learning how to curse the Pope in Irish, while potentially humorous and soul-satisfying, is a mere symbolic victory and does nothing to address the underlying issues of the English Murder Machine and the poison that it had already spread. In fact, this possibility would be more insidious if the old system was maintained apart from this singular change. This  would only  give the appearance of victory and in turn delude many into believing that victory had actually been achieved, while in the background the gears of the Murder Machine would continue to grind away the soul of the Irish race.

Lastly, the idea that a modern and progressive Irish people were deserving of an appropriately “sound modern education” only goes to show that the Murder Machine had spiritually disoriented a great many of the Irish. That this type of thinking persists into contemporary Ireland highlights the nature of the problem we are dealing with. Until this infectious type of thinking is exterminated, a comprehensively revolutionary education system will always be in danger of being subverted by the remnant mind-viruses of the Murder Machine.

Pearse describes  this view as the most vile of the aforementioned saying “there can be no such thing as ‘a sound modern education’ —as well talk about ‘lively modern faith’ or a ‘serviceable modern religion’. “It should be obvious that the more ‘modern’ an education is the less ‘sound’, for in education ‘modernism’ is as much a heresy as in religion.”

Modern man is too fond of congratulating himself for living in modern times. The view that we are merely actors upon the stage of a natural ‘progression’ via ‘evolution’ with no say in the matter forms the basis of the scientistic and freemasonic view of life, which remains incongruous with the Catholic conception of life, history, and society. Unknowingly, these prophets and poets of modernity merely grope at what was wholly grasped by ancient men: the solutions were long ago solved by our ancestors and have only been forgotten, ignored, or deliberately hidden. The solutions are there, and our ideal education system has been there before, but because we fail in a positive formulation and clearness of vision we cannot find them.

##### V AN IDEAL IN EDUCATION

Pearse presents a positive ideal towards which an Irish education system should strive. This would be achieved not through a mere counter-revolution to the status quo of English empiricism, liberalism, and modernism, but through a true ‘revolution’. A true revolution deriving from the Latin term ‘re-volvere’ defining a return to the origins. Therefore, Pearse prescribes a retracing of steps towards the original Gaelic education system as a means of escaping and overcoming the English Murder Machine.

For us to return we must first understand the original Gaelic conception of education, which can be seen through the language used to describe the education system. As Pearse notes, “The words and phrases of a language are always to some extent revelations of the mind of the race that has moulded the language”. The old Irish utilised words such as aite for teacher; meaning ‘fosterer’, dalta for pupil; meaning ‘foster-child’, and aiteachas for the system; meaning ‘fosterage’. Through the use of these specific words the old Irish showed “that they had gripped the very heart of that problem”, they understood what the end of true education was –to foster.

Education should not be “to inform, to indoctrinate, to conduct through a course of studies, but, first and last, to ‘foster’ the elements of character native to a soul, to help bring these to their full perfection rather than to implant exotic excellences.” Unfortunately, this goal was not to be achieved after the Rising through which Pearse sacrificed himself for Ireland, nor in the Free State which arose out of the ensuing situation.

Fundamentally restructuring the Irish education system came secondary after a host of other concerns. Realising the long lasting fruits of a properly oriented education system took a particular idealist character and sufficient genius, neither of which remained at the helm of Irish affairs post-1922, and so we find Ireland again desperately needing a revival of her education system.

“Education is as much concerned with souls as religion is. Religion is a Way of Life, and education is a preparation of the soul to live its life”. In Ireland, at the time Pearse was writing, it was true that a great deal of the education was done through Catholic schools, with the examples of Clongowes and Belvedere being run by the Jesuits and the multitude of Christian Brother Schools scattered throughout the country. However, due to the centralised education apparatus of the Department of Education, these schools were still not free of English intervention and influence. This situation has only worsened over time. It is not uncommon now for attendees of so-called ‘Catholic’ schools to be bombarded with talks on topics wholly divergent and directly antagonistic towards a Catholic worldview; with topics such as safe-sex, pro-LGBT, or pro-Abortion becoming state mandated.

Escaping this, and returning to a Catholic order, demands that we study our roots. For a truly Catholic and Gaelic education system to take shape, Catholics must free themselves from the shackles of our anti-Catholic, secular age, and return to our roots. They may have the buildings, but we will have the education. Like the Peripatetics who followed Aristotle, or indeed Our Lord Himself and his Disciples, we see that a school does not require a building, but can instead describe a group centred around one ‘master’. This was the conception of the “old Gael, pagan, and Christian” and which existed as the bedrock of European learning throughout the Middle Ages, as seen in the guild system. A system which Father Denis Fahey C.S.Sp. argues was the closest approximation to the divine programme of Our Lord Jesus. As we stray further away from this diving programme we decay into the secular cesspool we see today.

While this ideal conception has been demonstrated to function and flourish, one wonders if a revival of this system is feasible today. Nevertheless, what is certain is that the current system cannot continue. This current system denigrates and degrades not only the conception of education itself, but the dignity of all those who partake. This old relation of master and disciple, fosterer and foster-child, of shepherd and flock is being done away with for a more ‘modern’, ‘up to date’, ‘efficient’ understanding of human beings and their fundamental dignity.

> The modern child is coming to regard his teacher as an official paid by the State to render him certain services; services which is it in his interest to avail of, since by doing so he will increase his earning capacity later on; but services the rendering and acceptance of which no more imply a sacred relationship that do the rendering and acceptance of the services of a dentist or chiropodist. 

Against this trend, it is essential that we revive our old education system. As Pearse proudly proclaims; “It is not merely that the old Irish had a good education system; they had the best and noblest that has ever been known among men.” With this as our inspiration, we can be assured that achieving these aims stands as a vital pillar of a truly Catholic and Gaelic Ireland. It was this education system that produced [Cú Chulainn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%BA_Chulainn) in pre-Christian times, and Naoimh [Colm Cille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columba), [Breandán](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_the_Navigator), and [Éanna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enda_of_Aran) in Christian times; one wonders what a revival of such a system could produce in the coming years; new Saints, new scholars, and new great Irishmen.

##### VI MASTERS AND DISCIPLES

Reiterating the point of the master-disciple relationship, Pearse tells us that “There were no State art schools, no State technical schools \[…] men became artists in the studio of some master-artist, men learned crafts in the workshop of some master-craftsman”. Through this mechanism of teaching there was no predetermined mould designed to create a mass of ready-mades according to the wishes of a hostile ruling elite, but rather, men were taught through the unique inspiration, guiding, and fostering of their master.

This was the harmonious state of affairs for centuries in Ireland. When Naoimh like [Ciarán](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciar%C3%A1n_of_Clonmacnoise), Éanna, and Colm Cille gathered around them their little group of foster children, they became “\[their] family, \[their] household, \[their] clann—many sweet and endearing words were used to mark the intimacy of that relationship”. The modern dynamic of ‘teacher-student’ only demonstrates the degeneration which came from rejecting the beautiful and intimate system we had inherited.

Pearse opines that there has been nothing more noble in the history of education than the “development of the old Irish plan of fosterage under a Christian rule, when to the pagan ideals of strength and truth there were added the Christian ideals of love and humility”. Today too many Catholics rush to dismiss or denounce our pre-Christian past, exclaiming that ours was a barbaric, primitive island before the arrival of [Naomh Pádraig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Patrick) and the Gospel. However, it was Naomh Pádraig himself who supervised the codification of the pre-Christian laws in the [Senchus Már](https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Early_Irish_law). A committee was convened by Naomh Pádraig: declaring that the laws of our pre-Christian Brehon system which did not contradict the Word of God or the laws of the Church could continue to be applied in our new Christian society. Given the unique predisposition of our Brehon laws to uphold ‘natural law’ there was little which needed to be changed, resulting in a seamless transition from a pre-Christian to Christian society. Thus, we should not look down our noses at our pre-Christian past with shame or disgust -instead we should be proud and knowledgeable about our past, something which this journal seeks to accomplish.

![Cluain Mhic Nóis](/images/blog/clonmacnoise.jpg "Cluain Mhic Nóis")

This Irish education system was open to any and all, rich man or poor man, prince or peasant, king or subject. Any man could visit [Cluain Eraird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clonard_Abbey), Árainn, or [Cluain Mhic Nóis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clonmacnoise), sit at the feet of [Fionán](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnian_of_Clonard), Éanna, or Ciarán and learn of their wisdom. It was the unique personality of these masters that drew their flocks, offering them inspiration and guidance, not a set of ready-made opinions and a dry assortment of facts and figures to be memorised to pass exams. Nor a domineering will, as to be imperious on weaker wills, but an enthusiasm so overwhelming that it kindled a new flame of appreciation in them. This can only be accomplished by allowing the students a certain freedom, a freedom to dispense the fog in front of their eyes, and to follow the Light which came into the world to lead men to virtue and salvation.

##### VII OF FREEDOM IN EDUCATION

There are two pillars of a true education system: freedom for the individual disciple and adequate inspiration from the master. Absent these pillars, the edifice of an education system crumbles to the ground. The old Irish system had these pillars in such strength and abundance that her education system stood tall and mighty against blowing winds attempting to dislodge her. Though alone, these pillars are insufficient, they must necessarily be accompanied by deep foundations; not on sand, but on Rock, namely, Catholicity.

Today, these pillars have been noticeably non-existent; we may say that Ireland had and has no education system at all, no matter how we may try to elaborate educational machinery or multiply educational programmes. The Murder Machine, lacking these pillars, compensated via thousands of buildings, legions of overpaid inspectors, battalions of underpaid teachers, a Compulsory Education Act, and a bulk code of the Commissioners of National Education, a scenario which repeats itself.

The first essential –freedom— is seldom understood properly in Ireland, as in a manner of speaking we have had no experience of freedom, having lost even the memory of freedom –true freedom and not tyranny masquerading as freedom. We hoped we had finally wrestled our freedom from the murderous clutches of the English, but alas, this was not the case. To this day, Ireland continues to suffer under English tyranny as they occupy our rightful territory in Ulster and have partitioned our island. Yet, the allegedly 'Free State' doesn't fare much better as day by day it sells itself to the highest bidder. Once again, Ireland summons her children to her flag, we must heed the call and fight for our freedom.

Pearse quipped that “Thou shalt not” is half the law of Ireland, and the other half is “Thou must”. These laws were nowhere more evident than in the classroom. Students were not and are not given the freedom to perfect themselves in line with the common good and natural law. In the Murder Machine of old, as it is in the Modern Murder Machine, children are denied the right to individual growth. ‘Thou shalt not’ develop in God’s way – ‘Thou must’ develop in the Board of Education’s way. Students are bound hand and foot, chained mind and soul, constricted morally, mentally, and physically by rules and regulations designed to strangle every inch of life out of Irish students, making them more easily controlled by our foreign, hostile overlords.

These rules and regulations give no recognition “of the differences between individuals, of the differences between localities, of the differences between urban and rural communities”. Each ‘individual’ must exist as a mere Thing, as a number, as something which can be analysed and examined, experimented and studied, moulded and finished, polished and primed; that which cannot be accounted for on the globalist or English spreadsheet or dataset is thought not to exist. Boys and girls, Gael and Saxon, rural farmer and urban middleman, there is no difference: each exists and represents one unit which passes through the Murder Machine.

In a true education system, these differences would be embraced and celebrated. To boys, masculine virtues, taught and inspired: strength, honour, courage, humility, integrity; for them to grow up to be men worthy of their wives and family, Éire, and Christ. Similarly, to girls, feminine virtues, taught and inspired: tenderness, loyalty, compassion, modesty, obedience; so that they too can grow up to be women worthy of their husbands and family, Éire, and Christ.

The ill conceived notion that education can be standardised and imposed on children from an external authority, sitting far away in their offices in the Department of Education, enforcing a particular method of education on all schools regardless of their circumstances, is the antithesis of true education. This was true when Pearse wrote it and even more true today as education has only become more standardised. The same textbooks, the same homework problems, the same projects, the same poems: all handed out by teachers diligently following their programming.

The teacher who really seeks to teach his students –parallel the mandated curriculum– to  broaden the horizons of his students, does so at his own peril. While this benefits students in the long run, it penalises the teacher by a reduction in his results fees. This immaterial fence keeps teachers in their paddock; like a dog and his shock collar, teachers are trained to never stray: without the need of observance, they keep themselves in line fearing the learned consequences. As Pearse recalls a teacher saying to him, “Culture is all very well in its way, but if you don’t stick to your programme your boys won’t pass.”

In contrast to these shackles, Pearse pleads for freedom: not anarchy, but for “freedom within the law, for liberty not license, for that true freedom which can only exist where there is discipline.”

##### VIII BACK TO THE SAGAS

Only from the Catholic religion can so potent an inspiration be found that it remains forever with an Irish child as he progresses through education and onto adult life. Always and everywhere, whispering to him in the wind, the echoes of this inspiration –strive to be thy best self. Any education system not rooted in Catholicity, or in Catholic principles,  is akin to a body without the heart; while it may retain the superficial appearance of an education system, through the looking glass we see that it fails in its most fundamental task: preparing a student for a complete life.

In addition to this, hero-stories and folklore, especially of our Celtic variety, inspire young minds to push themselves to greater heights than they previously thought imaginable. As Pearse put it, “A heroic tale is more essentially a factor in education than a proposition in Euclid \[…] the story of the young Napoleon means more for boys than all the algebra in all the books”. This is not to say that these other elements of education such as art, or mathematics, or science are not important in their own right, but should be of secondary focus. Yet, these subjects too could inspire if they were taught by actual artists and scientists, and not merely from civil servants waving a certificate from the Department. Literature also has an immense power for inspiration, but when enjoyed as literature and not studied only as “texts” to be analysed and deconstructed.

When starting [Scoil Éanna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Enda's_School), Pearse introduced his ideas for an education system to the young boys from the beginning; encouraging them to become true Irish men: noble, virtuous, strong, brave, Catholic and Gaelic:

We must re-create and perpetuate in Ireland the knightly tradition of Cuchulainn, ‘better is short life with honour than long life with dishonour;’ ‘I care not though I were to live but one day and one night, if only my fame and deeds, live after me;’ the noble tradition of the Fianna, ‘we, the Fianna, never told a lie, falsehood was never imputed to us;’ ‘strength in our hands, truth on our lips, and cleanness in our hearts;’ the Christ-like tradition of Colmcille, ‘if I die it shall be from the excess of the love I bear the Gael.’



![Scoil Éanna](/images/blog/img_3200.jpg "Scoil Éanna")

While standing on the shoulders of giants and looking far into the future is a noble and gratifying act, we need also look back at the giants who came before us: Aodh Ruadh, Wolf Tone, Robert Emmet, and John Mitchell to name a few. The stories and deeds of these great men should be a cornerstone of an Irish education system: to inspire us into the future, to guide us in striving for virtue, and to foster a collective sense of what it means to be Irish.

This ‘nationalistic’ factor in education is of chief importance, it acts directly upon a child’s heart and soul, urging him to greatness. Any schooling system which disregards this national factor commits, even from a purely pedagogic standpoint, a terrible blunder, as it neglects one of the most compelling of educational methods.

It is no surprise to see that this factor was purposefully excluded from the English Murder Machine, as it is also excluded today, yet in an arguably more detrimental style. Today it is not only that the national factor has been excluded, but that it has been replaced with a negation; rather than something to be proud of or inspired by, our faith, our culture, our history, and our traditions are denigrated and desacralised in accordance with the new zeitgeist of modernity: self-hatred, anti-nationalism, and anti-Catholicism. The Murder Machine, past and present, has taken Irish minds and souls hostage, intoxicated them on the fumes of false freedoms, and defiled them upon the altar of modernity.

This method of deliberate attack upon the soul of the Irish race was so successful in Pearse’s time that he writes,  “it has succeeded –succeeded in making slaves of us. And it has succeeded so well that we no longer think we are slaves. Some of us even think our chains ornamental, and are doubtful as to whether we shall be quite as comfortable and quite as respectable when they are hacked off.” This debasing attitude is a corollary of English manipulation: the idea that Ireland is ‘not good enough’ to see to her own affairs and must instead delegate powers off to some alien entity is a product of modernity, and is to be found nowhere in our early history. This mindset is best summarised in the treacherous retort of Micheál Martin when he arrogantly declared to be speaking on behalf of Ireland claiming that “we want nothing to do with a backward-looking idea of sovereignty”. Of course Micheál, himself a creation of the Modern Murder Machine, fully imbibes their qualitative principles.

Instilling this attitude among a large cohort of the Irish population, primarily concentrated in the English Pale as they are, might well be considered the crowning achievement of the English Murder Machine. While the Murder Machine was removed or destroyed (to the extent that English rule was nominally out of Ireland), its lasting effects carried on in the minds of those already poisoned. The Irish race once wanted freedom so passionately that many of its best sons and daughters spilled their blood in the hopes of achieving it, yet now we seem unwilling to hack off our chains due to our poisoned and disoriented senses resulting from the Murder Machine.

Highlighting how effective these results have been, Pearse reminds us of the many previous attempts by the English to wipe out the Irish national consciousness which had been ineffectual. Cromwell failed to trample it out, [na Péindlíthe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penal_Laws_against_Irish_Catholics) failed to crush it, the horrors of ’98 had not daunted it, [Pitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Pitt_the_Younger#Ireland) had not purchased it; nay, after all these attempts that national consciousness –enshrined in a national language—endured. Less than a century under the English Murder Machine and this consciousness was in grave danger, and one wonders now, when looking at the present time, whether they have been successful. Or does there still survive, hidden in sacred shade on eternal hills, that flame of Irishness? This flame illuminated the path followed by Ireland’s greatest heroes; if  we could only discover it once more, we too could walk this noble path.

Simply introducing a new and ideal education system is insufficient, we will also need to “restore manhood to a race that has been deprived of it.” Though we may not be able to send our children to the heroes, seers, and scholars of old to be fostered, we can still bring these heroes, seers, and scholars into the schools. This responsibility lies with the individual teachers: to bring this inspiration to their students, for their benefit and the benefit of the Irish race as a whole.

Finding these teachers will require a total reconsideration of what we look for in our teachers. No more can we collect our teachers out of the scrapheap of rejected waste of the other professions, no more than we can find them in the ranks of the wasters and the uncaring; nay, we must demand that the vocation of the teacher should be a priestlike office, accepting only the highest souls and noblest intellects of our race. Regrettably, only with rare exceptions do we find teachers worthy of the vocation who are willing to work in such demoralising and soul-destroying conditions as regards personal dignity, freedom, and financial difficulties. It is a lamentable fact, and a scandal, to consider that the teachers worthy of the profession are at a salary less than one-fourth of Varadkar’s advisors.

##### IX WHEN WE ARE FREE

Throughout his essay, Pearse reveals the overarching ideal with which an Irish education system would be created, leaving little in lieu of specifics. These specific mechanisms regarding how the system would function are of less importance than the motivating ideal. What is the telos for a schooling system?, is a more pressing matter than how this will be obtained: A traveller first decides his destination before the journey can then be chosen. This notwithstanding, Pearse does give us one insight into an action which must be taken –destruction. “The lusty strokes of Gael and Gall, Ulster taking its manful part, will hew away and cast adrift the rotten and worm-eaten boards which support the grotesque fabric of the English education system.”

Pearse imagined that with the first Irish Government there would have been a first Irish Minister of Education responsible to the Irish Parliament and people; under him a new Irish education system would need to be fashioned to suit the needs of the Irish people. The same necessity exists for us today: that when a truly nationalist and Irish government –not puppets upon the strings of bureaucrats in faraway lands— assume control over this country, a substantial and radical transformation of our education system must be of prime importance.

Pearse identified Dublin Castle as having a finger in the pie, just as it had its finger in every unsavoury pie in Ireland. Yet behind Dublin Castle, across the Irish sea, loomed the true master of Dublin Castle –the British Treasury. Likewise, today we find that it is globalist institutions that have their fingers in every pie, influencing and disturbing events as they see fit. What is needed is not to just slap away the hand from which the finger extends, but to sever the hand entirely so that it may never interfere again. A total disconnect of any and all globalist influence is a fundamental requirement for a truly free and Gaelic Ireland.

The native Irish language remains a tricky subject for the future ahead. We must confess that Irish is not sufficiently known for it to be adopted immediately as the dominant language. A gradual process of reintroduction is needed. This goes to the very heart of the matter: how is it that we can be mandated to study Irish from the age of four through to eighteen (roughly speaking) and still be incapable of conversing in our native tongue? This ought to arouse suspicion, even in the slowest mind. This is the deliberate, manufactured product of a hostile ruling structure; they know well that if Gaels were to speak again in their native tongue that we would be “shrewder and more suttler” than the English, or any other structure seeking dominion over our people.

Pearse understands this issue and as such gives plans as to how to reintroduce the language to dominance, as it ought to be. “Irish should be made the language of instruction in districts where it is the home language, and English the ‘second language’, taught as a school subject: I would not at any stage use English as a medium of instruction in such districts \[…] Where English is the home language it must of necessity be the ‘first language’ in the schools, but I would have a compulsory ‘second language’, satisfied that this ‘second language’ would be Irish.” While this may have sounded all well and good when many of the population still spoke Irish, today this plan is not feasible, the massive influx of non-Irish in recent times notwithstanding.

This plan, however, entails that the centre of gravity of school standardising should be transferred away from an education office and instead handed over to teachers, in effect making teachers the system. “Teachers, not clerks, would henceforth conduct the education of the country.” This shift must be made throughout the schooling hierarchy, with teachers at the base, then inspectors being selected from the teachers, and the chiefs of departments selected from the inspectors; although a central authority would be required to “maintain a standard, to advise, to inspire, to keep the teachers in touch with educational thought in other lands”.

In ending his essay, Pearse gives us a lovely image of the future education system in Ireland, an idea which can only be brought to fruition through action:

> Well-trained and well-paid teachers, well-equipped and beautiful schools, and a fund at the disposal of each school to enable it to award prizes on its own tests based on its own programme –these would be among the characteristics of a new secondary system. Manual work, both indoor and outdoor, would, I hope, be part of the programme of every school \[…] fostering of individualities yet never at the expense of the common wealth, their care for the body as well as for the mind, their nobly-ordered games, their spacious outdoor life, their daily adventure face to face with elemental Life and Force, with its moral disciple, with its hardening.
>
> And then. Vivifying the whole, we need the divine breath that moves through free peoples, the breath that no man of Ireland has felt in his nostrils for so many centuries, the breath that once blew through the streets of Athens and that kindles, as wine kindles, the hearts of those who taught and learned in Clonmacnoise.

The telos of this journal is to resurrect Pearse’s ideals in the field of education. To bring back our faith, our culture, our history, our folklore, and our language, out of the mist and into the light to be comprehended once again. For the Gael to rise, phoenix-like from the ashes, reasserting himself in the world as a force for Good, a force for Christ. This ideal explains the choosing of our name, ‘An Dord Fiann’: the name of the horn of na Fianna, who, according to legend, lay asleep, waiting for Ireland to call them to her heart in her time of need. They lie in rest waiting for the horn to be thrice sounded, for its sounds to ring out across the fields and bogs, lakes and rivers, and over the hills and mountains of our beautiful Éire: at which point they will arise and race to her in her time of need. The powerful quote which motivated and inspired the creation of this journal comes from Pearse: “I am nothing so new-fangled as a socialist or a syndicalist, I am old fashioned enough to be a Catholic and a Nationalist”. This quote will serve as a motto for the journal, that despite a wide ranging field of interest and potential articles, we hope that they may endeavour to be, at root, both uniquely Catholic and Nationalist, in a way that only the Irish race could produce.
