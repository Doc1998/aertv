Stripe is a financial technology company that provides online payment processing for businesses. It was founded by two Irish brothers, John Collison and Patrick Collison. Here's more about them:

**John Collison:** John Collison was born on July 9, 1990, in Limerick, Ireland. He showed an early aptitude for programming and technology. While attending Castletroy College, he won the Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition, a prestigious science competition in Ireland, for creating a programming language translator.

After high school, John pursued his studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the United States. During his time there, he co-founded Auctomatic, a software company that focused on tools for online auctions. Auctomatic was later acquired, providing John with valuable entrepreneurial experience.

**Patrick Collison:** Patrick Collison was born on September 9, 1988, also in Limerick, Ireland. Like his brother John, Patrick displayed remarkable intellectual abilities from a young age. He won the Esat Young Scientist of the Year award at the age of 16, further showcasing his talents.

Following in his brother's footsteps, Patrick attended MIT. Before co-founding Stripe, he co-founded Shuppa, an auction and marketplace software company, when he was just 16 years old.

**Founding of Stripe:** John and Patrick Collison founded Stripe in 2010. Their goal was to simplify online transactions for businesses by providing a straightforward and developer-friendly platform for accepting payments. The idea for Stripe came from their own frustrations with the complexity of online payment systems they encountered while running their earlier ventures.

Stripe's success was driven by its ease of use, robust features, and focus on developer tools. The platform allowed businesses to integrate payment processing seamlessly into their websites and apps. Over time, Stripe expanded its services to include subscription billing, fraud prevention, and more, becoming a major player in the fintech industry.

The Collison brothers' innovative approach and dedication to improving online payments have contributed to Stripe's global success. The company's headquarters are in San Francisco, but its Irish roots remain evident in its co-founders and their journey from a small town in Ireland to shaping the future of online commerce.
